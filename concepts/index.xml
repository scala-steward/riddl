In Domain-Driven Design, this concept is known as an anti-corruption layer that keeps the ubiquitous language of one context &amp;ldquo;corrupting&amp;rdquo; the language of another context. The authors of RIDDL didn&amp;rsquo;t like that term for a variety of reasons so we have renamed the concept as adaptor in RIDDL. Same idea, different name.

Applications only define the net result of the interaction between the user and the application. They are abstract on purpose. That is, there is nothing in RIDDL that defines how information is provided to a user nor received from a user. This gives free latitude to the user interface designer to manage the entire interaction between human and machine.</description></item><item><title>Application Element</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/element/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/element/</guid><description>Elements are the definitions that define the user interface for an application.

A bounded context is an isolated portion of some knowledge domain. Consequently, in RIDDL we defined a context inside a domain. DDD uses bounded contexts to divide complexity in large knowledge domains into manageable portions. Since large knowledge domains are difficult for a single human to comprehend in its entirety, DDD uses bounded contexts as a primary structuring tool.</description></item><item><title>Definition</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/definition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/definition/</guid><description>RIDDL is a declarative language, in that it declares the definition of certain concrete concepts in a hierarchical fashion. The notion of a definition is abstract since there are many types of definitions, all described in this concepts section. Succinctly, a definition is anything that has a unique name that we call its identifier.
Common Attributes All definitions have some common attributes:

We use the word domain in the sense of a knowledge domain; like an entire business, a field of study, or some portion of these. It has nothing to do with Internet domain names. A domain is an arbitrary boundary around some subset of concepts in the universe. As with Domain Driven Design, RIDDL uses the concept of a domain to group together a set of related concepts.</description></item><item><title>Entity</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/entity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/entity/</guid><description>An entity in RIDDL is the same as it is in DDD which defines it this way:
Entity Definitions
An object primarily defined by its identity is called an Entity.
and
Many objects are not fundamentally defined by their attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and identity.
There are three main aspects to this definition of entity:
Entities in the software implementation of the model are objects, containing both state and function.</description></item><item><title>Epics</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/epic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/epic/</guid><description>An epic in RIDDL is a definition that defines a large user story with a set of use cases. This is the same concept as the idea Kent Beck introduced in 1997. In RIDDL, a story gets a little more involved than the usual formulations of a user story:
As an {user}, I would like {capability}, so that {benefit}
or
In order to receive {benefit}, as an {user}, I can {capability}</description></item><item><title>Field</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/field/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/field/</guid><description>Fields are the unit of composition of an aggregate type, state, or projection. A field is a simple mapping of a name to a type. For example:

Groups can be nested which allows them to form a hierarchy that defines the structure of a user interface. Each group can also contain UI elements such as inputs and outputs as well as types. To make this more tangible, groups could be used to model the following implementation concepts:
HTML forms, pages, containers, and sections mobile application screens, pages, forms and containers accordions (vertically stacked list of items with show/hide functionality) A UI designer is free to arrange the contained elements in any fashion, but presumably in a way that is consistent with their overall UI design theme.</description></item><item><title>Handlers</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/handler/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/handler/</guid><description>A handler is a very important definition in RIDDL because it is RIDDL&amp;rsquo;s way of expressing both business logic and relationships between the various components in a model. Handlers do that by specifying what should be done whenever a message of a particular type is received by its parent definition. Handlers are composed as a set of on clauses that connect a message with a set of
statements. The statements provide the business logic that should be executed upon receipt of the message.</description></item><item><title>Includes</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/include/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/include/</guid><description>Includes permit you to include content from a file into the definition in which it occurs.

To make this more tangible, inputs could be implemented as any of the following:
the submission of a typical htML form a user could fill in, the tap of a button on a mobile device, the selection of items from a list on a native application, a voice response providing information via any IVR system, a thought interpreted by a neural link, a physical movement interpreted by a motion-detection device, a retinal scan, picking items from lists of information by looking and blinking or any other system by which a human may provide information to a machine The nature of the implementation for an input is up to the UI Designer.</description></item><item><title>Invariants</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/invariant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/invariant/</guid><description>An invariant is a logical expression that must always hold true.

Messages in RIDDL are a special case of an aggregate type and the lingua franca of many RIDDL definitions. They define the API for:
adaptors
applications
contexts
entitys
processors
projectors
and repositorys
That is, these are the fundamental building blocks of a message-driven system
Differences Between Kinds of Messages RIDDL follows Bertrand Meyer&amp;rsquo;s notion of command/query separation which states, in the context of object-oriented programming in Eiffel that:</description></item><item><title>On Clauses</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/onclause/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/onclause/</guid><description>An On Clause specifies how to handle a particular kind of message or situation as part of the definition of a [handler](/concepts/handler/. An On Clause is associated with a specific message definition and contains statements that define the handling of that message by the handler&amp;rsquo;s parent. An On Clause is also optionally associated with an entity or pipe) as the sender of a message.
There are fours kinds of On Clauses:</description></item><item><title>Options</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/option/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/option/</guid><description>Options are instructions to translators on how a particular definition should be regarded. Any translator can make use of any option. Options can take a list of string arguments much like the options and arguments to a program. If none are specified, the option is considered to be a Boolean value that is true if specified.
Every vital definition in RIDDL allows a technology option that takes any number of string arguments.</description></item><item><title>Outlets</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/outlet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/outlet/</guid><description>An Outlet is a component of a Processor that specifies a named output through which data of a particular type streams out of the processor.

To make this more tangible, an Output could be implemented as any of the following:
the text shown on a web page or mobile application the display of an interactive graphic, chart, etc. the presentation of a video or audio recording haptic, olfactory or gustatory feedback any other way in which a human can receive information from a machine.</description></item><item><title>Pipes</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/pipe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/pipe/</guid><description>Pipes are uni-directional conduits for reliably transmitting data of a particular type.
Data Transmission Type Pipes can transmit any data type that RIDDL can specify. There is only one data type that flows in a pipe. The transmission type is often used with an alternation of messages such as the commands and queries that an entity might receive.
Pipe End Connections Pipes have two ends, from and to, and each must be connected to a processor.</description></item><item><title>Processors</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/processor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/processor/</guid><description>A processor is a component of any vital definition. A processor performs some transformation of the data flowing in from its inlet, and produces different data to its outlet.
Inlets An inlet provides the name and data type for an input to the processor. There can be multiple inlets to the processor or none. A processor with no inlets defined is called a source since it originates data by itself.</description></item><item><title>Projectors</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/projector/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/projector/</guid><description>Projections get their name from
Euclidean Geometry but are probably more analogous to a relational database view. The concept is very simple in RIDDL: projections gather data from entities and other sources, transform that data into a specific record type, and support querying that data arbitrarily.
Projections transform update events from entities into a data set that can be more easily queried. Projections have handlers that specify both how to apply updates to the projections state and satisfy queries against that state.</description></item><item><title>Repository</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/repository/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/repository/</guid><description>A RIDDL repository is an abstraction for anything that can retain information (e.g. messages) for retrieval at a later time. This might be a relational database, NoSQL database, a data lake, an API, or something not yet invented. There is no specific technology implied other than the retention and retrieval of information. You should think of repositories more like a message-oriented version of the Java Repository Pattern than any particular kind of database.</description></item><item><title>Root</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/root/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/root/</guid><description>The root concept refers to the container of domains. Domains are the top level definition in RIDDL but because RIDDL is hierarchical, and you can have more than one domain definition at the top level, something has to contain those top level domains. We call that the root. A root is not a definition since it has no name. You can think of a root as the file in which a domain is defined.</description></item><item><title>Saga Steps</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/sagastep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/sagastep/</guid><description>One step in a saga.
