We use the word domain in the sense of a knowledge domain; like an entire business, or some portion of it. It has nothing to do with Internet domain names. A domain is an arbitrary boundary around some subset of concepts in the universe. As with Domain Driven Design, RIDDL uses the concept of a domain to group together a set of related concepts.</description></item><item><title>Entities</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/entities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/entities/</guid><description>Entities are definitions of &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo;

Domains are the top level definition in RIDDL but because RIDDL is hierarhical, and you can have more than one domain definition at the top level, something has to contain those top level domains. We call that the root. A root is not a definition since it has no name. You can think of a root as the file in which a domain is defined.</description></item><item><title>States</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/states/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/states/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Stories</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/stories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/stories/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Terms</title><link>https://riddl.tech/concepts/terms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/concepts/terms/</guid><description>TBD

RIDDL&amp;rsquo;s type system is fairly rich, for a specification language, providing abstractions for many concretely common information structures. This is done to make it easier for domain engineers and experts to understand the models they are creating.
A type defines the shape of some information. There are many kinds of type definitions allowed, so we have grouped them into categories:</description></item></channel></rss>
