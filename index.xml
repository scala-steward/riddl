As there are overlaps
Options come and go as riddlc evolves. If you experience issues with the command line options, you can always run riddlc without any options and it will explain the options your version supports. Common Options Some options are common to all the commands.</description></item><item><title>CEO of Reactive BBQ</title><link>https://riddl.tech/tutorial/reactivebbqusecase/ceo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 14:36:43 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/tutorial/reactivebbqusecase/ceo/</guid><description>How would you describe your restaurants?
Reactive BBQ is a family restaurant with 500 locations across 20 countries. We&amp;rsquo;re open for breakfast, lunch and supper. Our specialty at Reactive BBQ is our award winning Reactive Ribs, but we are also well known for our tender steaks and our slow roasted chicken. We take traditional BBQ flavours and give them a bit of a spicy punch. The customer experience at each Reactive BBQ should have the same high level of quality across the globe.</description></item><item><title>riddlc --help</title><link>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/compilingriddl/riddlc-help/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:19:59 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/compilingriddl/riddlc-help/</guid><description>riddlc is the command that makes all the magic happen.

RIDDL Compiler (c) 2022 Reactive Software LLC. All rights reserved. Version: 0.5.0-11-e0fd90eb-20220301-1528 This program parses, validates and translates RIDDL sources to other kinds of documents. RIDDL is a language for system specification based on Domain Drive Design, Reactive Architecture, and Agile principles.</description></item><item><title>Binary AST</title><link>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/translation/bast/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/translation/bast/</guid><description>When the riddlc compiler parses a RIDDL document, it translates it to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in memory. The AST is then used by other passes to validate and translate the AST into other forms. The binary AST (BAST) translator converts the AST in memory into a binary format that is stored for later usage. Saving the BAST format and then reading it back into the compiler avoids the time to both parse the RIDDL document and validate it for consistency.</description></item><item><title>Language Conventions</title><link>https://riddl.tech/language/conventions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/language/conventions/</guid><description>Introduction Syntax conventions of RIDDL are very simple and lenient. The intended audience is business owners, business analysts, domain engineers, and software architects. It is intentionally simple and readable. The language is free in its formatting. It does not require indentation and its various constructs can be arranged on any line. RIDDL supports the definition of a variety of concepts taken directly from Domain Driven Design and the Unified Modeling Language as well as software architecture.</description></item><item><title>State</title><link>https://riddl.tech/language/root/domain/context/entity/state/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/language/root/domain/context/entity/state/</guid><description>The state definitions of an entity define the structure of the information that the entity retains as its current state.
Syntax Example The state of an entity is defined with the state keyword within the content of an entity definition, like this:
entity Car { type Propulsion = any of { ICE, Electric, Steam, Diesel, EMDrive } state Static is { wheels: Integer doors: Integer rightHandDrive: Boolean propulsion: Propulsion } } One of the primary purposes of an entity is to represent the characteristics of the entity with state information.</description></item><item><title>Terminals</title><link>https://riddl.tech/audience/developers-guide/grammar/terminals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/audience/developers-guide/grammar/terminals/</guid><description>This file shows the definition of the terminal symbols, as productions, and grouped in categories:

Each definition can have a description. Descriptions are used to generate documentation and follow markdown conventions.
Examples There are several ways to describe a definition. In each of the examples we attach a description to some domain named Foo. The definition is not important for our purposes here. Descriptions come after the definition using one of four phrases:</description></item><item><title>Options</title><link>https://riddl.tech/language/root/domain/context/entity/options/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/language/root/domain/context/entity/options/</guid><description>The optional entity kind prefix is a directive that suggests how the entity might handle its state and received messages. In the example above, we expect the &amp;ldquo;Printer&amp;rdquo; entity to be a physical device. An &amp;ldquo;actor&amp;rdquo; entity in of the same name could be expected to be a person who prints.
The options available suggest how the entity might handle its state and message input:
kind - indicates the intended kind of entity in an argument to the kind entity.</description></item><item><title>riddlc Examples</title><link>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/compilingriddl/riddlcexamples/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 15:48:53 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/compilingriddl/riddlcexamples/</guid><description>Because riddlc is a very rich command, we thought it might be useful to provide some examples. We use these commands in our day to day work and hope that these examples give you ideas on how to adapt riddlc to your particular work style and needs.
riddlc can be invoked in two ways (both from the command line):
Install riddl via the provided installer for your operating system. Open a command prompt and enter a riddlc command.</description></item><item><title>Corporate Head Chef</title><link>https://riddl.tech/tutorial/reactivebbqusecase/headchef/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 14:36:52 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/tutorial/reactivebbqusecase/headchef/</guid><description>What is your role in the restaurant?
Corporate wants each restaurant to have a consistent experience. My job is to create new recipes to be included in the menu. I spend a lot of time trying out different ingredients and flavours to try to get the right balance for our menu. I have to be careful to stick to ingredients that we can buy in sufficient quantities.

Such references are called Path Identifiers. They work a lot like a Unix file system with files (leaves) and directories (branches).
Please consider the following example as you read the sections below

Invariants typically come from business logic assertions. For example, a business axiom of a warehouse might be that the supply of a product should never be below 1. That is, the warehouse should never completely run out of a product it is storing. Reality, of course, must account for the supply running out; nevertheless specifying an invariant on the business intent may be important.</description></item><item><title>Pipes</title><link>https://riddl.tech/language/root/domain/streaming/pipe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/language/root/domain/streaming/pipe/</guid><description>Pipes are uni-directional conduits for reliably transmitting data of a particular type between the publishers and consumers attached at the ends of the pipe.
Syntax Example pipe WeatherForecast is { options rate(1000), paritions(7), transmits type Forecast } In the foregoing, a pipe named WeatherForecast is defined to transmit the data type named Forecast and with two options:
rate - an expected sustained rate of 1000 data points per second partitions - a minimum number of partitions on the data of 7 Data Transmission Type Pipes can transmit any data type that RIDDL can specify.</description></item><item><title>RBBQ Scenarios</title><link>https://riddl.tech/examples/scenario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/examples/scenario/</guid><description>Case Study The Reactive BBQ restaurant chain has determined that their existing restaurant operations system is not suitably meeting their needs and have hired a high technology consulting company to provide some needed guidance on how they can improve their customer service, tracking, and reliability.

You may define as many plants as needed but each plant is a closed system without the ability of the RIDDL model to express the sharing of data between the plants. This is done deliberately to prevent unintentional contamination of data in large models.
Joints The purpose of a plant definition is to provide the blueprint for how a set of pipes, processors, and entities are joined together so that data may flow end-to-end.</description></item><item><title>Principles</title><link>https://riddl.tech/audience/developers-guide/principles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/audience/developers-guide/principles/</guid><description>RIDDL is a high level system specification language and as such must obey some principles of such languages.

I take drink orders at the bar and entertain the guests. I mix the drinks and take them to the customers when they are ready. When the customer is done for the day I help them settle their tab.

Handlers are specified with the handler keyword and enclose a set of on clauses that specify what to do with a given event when that handler is active. There are four kinds of on clauses distinguished by the kind of message they handle (command, event, query, and reaction) as detailed in the following sections

Instead of specifying those concepts in a visual way, as in UML, RIDDL specifies them in a textual way. The purpose of an interaction is to specify an important way in which the system components communicate and cooperate to accomplish a task that is valuable to the stakeholders of the system.
As with the UML concept, an interaction shows the message flow between system entities in time sequence.</description></item><item><title>Kalix</title><link>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/translation/kalix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/translation/kalix/</guid><description>The Kalix platform-as-a-service system represents one of the easiest methods by which RIDDL models can be turned into running systems.

I oversee the entire kitchen and all of its staff. I source local ingredients required to prepare our menu items. The menu is decided on monthly and distributed via email. I inspect all prepared orders that leave the kitchen.
What challenges do you face?
I think the worst thing is when the system that prints our orders goes haywire. Sometimes the system crashes and orders get lost.</description></item><item><title>Akka</title><link>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/translation/akka/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/tooling/riddlc/translation/akka/</guid><description>The goal of the Akka translator is to generate all the infrastructure code needed to support the domain(s) defined in the RIDDL input. While this does produce a working system, it also relieves developers of much of the repetitive, detail oriented infrastructure that is relatively boring compared to the business logic of the system.
This translator recognizes that its output will be co-mingled with the business logic output that developers are writing and keeps them separate.</description></item><item><title>Documentation Conventions</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/conventions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/conventions/</guid><description>This page defines the conventions we use throughout this documentation.

Well, I go to the website and they have their menu there. I have a look at the menu and decide what I want. The menu is organized into different sections, like lunch, dinner, appetizers, dessert, that sort of thing. The menu online isn&amp;rsquo;t identical to what I get in the restaurant, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty close.
