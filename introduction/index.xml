RIDDL is also a set of tools, implemented in this GitHub repository, that allow humans to work with the language and generate things from it.</description></item><item><title>What can RIDDL do?</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/what-can-riddl-do/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 10:07:32 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/what-can-riddl-do/</guid><description>RIDDL is a software specification language. As a consequence of it being a language, it has a software tool, riddlc, that can be used to do a variety of things. Most of those things involve reading riddl input files checking them, and producing some output file(s).
Input The input to riddlc is always a single file with the .riddl suffix. This is a text file that contains definitions in the RIDDL syntax.</description></item><item><title>What is RIDDL Based On?</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/what-is-riddl-based-on/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:15:51 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/what-is-riddl-based-on/</guid><description>The RIDDL specification language borrows concepts from:
Domain Driven Design (DDD) Reactive System Architecture (RSA) Unified Modeling Language (UML) Agile User Stories Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and other widely adopted software development and design practices. RIDDL aims to capture business concepts and architectural details in a way that is consumable by business oriented professionals yet can also be directly translated into various technical and non-technical artifacts, including:
a documentation web-site various architectural diagrams (context maps, sequence diagrams, and so on) design input to code generators (e.</description></item><item><title>Why Is RIDDL Needed?</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/why-is-riddl-needed/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 10:07:32 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/why-is-riddl-needed/</guid><description>The originator of RIDDL, Reid Spencer, got to a point in his 40+ year career where the job of software development became tedious and repetitive. He decided to do something about it.
1990s rise of 4GLs Insufficient existing specification languages Something simpler for business users Something highly translatable for code generation Recognizing that Ai will soon write software Need specifications that can be translated to many forms Need something easily readable Self-documenting specifications</description></item><item><title>Documentation Conventions</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/conventions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/conventions/</guid><description>This page defines the conventions we use throughout this documentation.
RIDDL Snippets Whenever we include RIDDL source code in the documentation it will be in a fixed sized font like this:
domain MyDomain is { ??? } Extended Backus-Naur Form When RIDDL grammar definitions are made, we utilize the EBNF grammar meta-language to specify the grammar. You can read about this grammar meta-language on Wikipedia For example, here&amp;rsquo;s how EBNF can define a quoted string:</description></item></channel></rss>
