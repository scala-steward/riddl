RIDDL is a variety of software libraries and tools, provided in this GitHub repository, that allow humans to work with the language to create their own derivative works.
[riddlc] is a complete extensible compiler infrastructure for processing RIDDL specifications. It uses a plugin system to allow new commands to be added to it for generating information from a RIDDL specification.</description></item><item><title>What can RIDDL do?</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/what-can-riddl-do/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 10:07:32 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/what-can-riddl-do/</guid><description>RIDDL is a software specification language. As a consequence of it being a language, it has a software tool, riddlc, that can be used to do a variety of things. Most of those things involve reading riddl input files checking them, and producing some output file(s).
Input The input to riddlc is always a single file with the .riddl suffix. This is a text file that contains definitions in the RIDDL syntax.</description></item><item><title>What is RIDDL Based On?</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/what-is-riddl-based-on/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:15:51 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/what-is-riddl-based-on/</guid><description>The RIDDL specification language borrows concepts from:
Domain Driven Design (DDD) Reactive System Architecture (RSA) Unified Modeling Language (UML) Agile User Stories Behavior Driven Development (BDD) C4 Model Of Software Architecture RIDDL aims to capture business concepts and architectural details in a way that is consumable by business professionals yet can also be directly translated into various technical and non-technical artifacts, including:
a documentation web-site various architectural diagrams (context maps, sequence diagrams, and so on) design input to code generators (e.</description></item><item><title>Who Can Benefit From RIDDL?</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/who-can-benefit-from-riddl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 10:07:32 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/who-can-benefit-from-riddl/</guid><description>RIDDL is technology-agnostic, but not design-agnostics. It is purposefully aimed at the design of large scale, web-sized, distributed systems based on reactive architecture. It allows specification of the design of a system, without regard to programming language, cloud vendor choice, or specific technology choices. Using RIDDL allows a living design to evolve through every stage of the development process and then through continuing maintenance and evolution of the system designed.</description></item><item><title>Who Made RIDDL Possible?</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/who-made-riddl-possible/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 10:07:32 -0700</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/who-made-riddl-possible/</guid><description>Originator Reid Spencer Deeply experienced system architect, software developer and entrepreneur. Initiated RIDDL in 2019 and started committing changes to the repository at the end of 2021 Founder of Reactific Software LLC which was bought by Ossum Inc. in 2022 which he also founded. Contributors James Lovell The original enthusiast, co-conspirator, shaper and user of the language, etc. RIDDL wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be where it is today without James&amp;rsquo; contributions.

He decided to do something about it.
Notes for future content TBD:
1990s rise of 4GLs Insufficient existing specification languages Something simpler for business users Something highly translatable for code generation Recognizing that Ai will soon write software Need specifications that can be translated to many forms Need something easily readable Self-documenting specifications</description></item><item><title>How Can I Get Help?</title><link>https://riddl.tech/introduction/how-can-i-get-help/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>reid@reactific.com (Reid Spencer)</author><guid>https://riddl.tech/introduction/how-can-i-get-help/</guid><description>How you will get help depends on what you want to get help with.
