Feature &amp;#34;Guess the word&amp;#34; is { // The first example has two steps Scenario &amp;#34;Maker starts a game&amp;#34; is { When the Maker starts a game Then the Maker waits for a Breaker to join } // The second example has three steps Scenario &amp;#34;Breaker joins a game&amp;#34; is { Given the Maker has started a game with a word When the Breaker joins the Maker&amp;#39;s game Then the Breaker must guess a word knowing the length of the Maker&amp;#39;s word choice.</description></item></channel></rss>
